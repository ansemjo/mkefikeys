# mkefikeys

To take full control of you computer's SecureBoot platform you need to generate a custom set of keys
and install them in your computer's firmware. Information on SecureBoot in general can be found on
Roderick W. Smith's [pages][0] and various [wiki][1] [pages][2].

## create signing keys

This makefile automates the creation of the required certificates and signed updates for your
firmware. GNU make 3.81+ is required.

    mkefikeys auth

## configure

The filenames can be customized with make variables `PK`, `KEK` and `DB`. Certificate subjects can
be customized by setting a format string in `SUBJECT`, where `%kt` will be replaced with the key
type. RSA key bits, validity period and key encryption can be configured with `BITS`, `DAYS` and
`ENCRYPT`.

    mkefikeys auth SUBJECT="/O=Acme Ltd./OU=SecureBoot/CN=My %kt/" ENCRYPT=yes

Install the `*.auth` files with your UEFI's builtin key management tool or use [KeyTool][3]. Then
use `sbsign` or [`mksignkernels`][4] to sign your kernels with `PlatformKey.{key,crt}`.

Should you need DER-encoded certificates for your firmware, you can output them to \*.cer files:

    mkefikeys der

You can also use different settings for each certificate with the `pk`, `kek` and `db` targets:

    mkefikeys pk kek ENCRYPT=yes
    mkefikeys db
    mkefikeys auth

## install

Install this programm with the included `install.mk` makefile. It optionally accepts a `DESTDIR`
argument for packaging:

    sudo make -f install.mk install DESTDIR=${pkgdir}

Arch Linux users can also use `makepkg -i` in this directory to install `mkefikeys-git` or install a
tagged version from AUR with `$aurhelper -S mkefikeys`.
